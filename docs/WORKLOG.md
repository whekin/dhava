## 2026-07-11 — Phase 0: monorepo skeleton

**Done:**
- Monorepo initialized (git, README, .gitignore, this docs/ set, CLAUDE.md → AGENTS.md).
- `android/`: multi-module Compose app (`:app`, `:core:ui`, `:feature:{record,segments,feed,profile}`),
  M3 Expressive theme (dark-first, seed #D84315, displayLarge 96sp), bottom nav,
  manifest pre-lists (commented) location/sensor/foreground permissions.
  `assembleDebug` green, APK 11.5 MB.
- `backend/`: Go 1.26 + chi + pgx. `/healthz`, `/readyz` (DB ping), `/api/v1/me` stub.
  Server boots without DB (warning). Migrations 0001: postgis, users, activities,
  raw_recordings. Distroless Dockerfile, Makefile, tests green.
- `fusion/`: workspace `fusion-core` + `fusion-worker`. Real `detect_gate_crossing`
  (equirectangular projection, segment intersection, bearing tolerance, time
  interpolation), 3 tests, clippy clean. Worker is a logging stub.
- `deploy/docker-compose.yml`: api + fusion-worker + postgis/postgis:17-3.5 + minio.
- `proto/openapi.yaml` stub.

**Open questions:**
- Coolify deploy not yet exercised (compose written, not applied).
- Strava API app registration not started (needed in Phase 3).

## 2026-07-11 — Phase 1: recording (done)

**Android** (new module `:core:recording` + rewritten `:feature:record`):
- RecordingService: foreground (location type), FusedLocation 1 Hz high-accuracy,
  accel/gyro/mag at SENSOR_DELAY_FASTEST, baro at fastest; all on a HandlerThread.
- Timestamps: single epoch anchor (currentTimeMillis − elapsedRealtime) computed at
  start, applied to both SensorEvent and Location elapsed-realtime stamps.
- IMU pairing: accel is the master clock; each accel event emits one `imu` line with
  the latest stashed gyro/mag. No gyroscope → `[0,0,0]` (spec requires the field).
- Writer: unbounded Channel → single-thread dispatcher → buffered GZIPOutputStream,
  ~2 s flush; sensor callbacks never block. Files: `filesDir/recordings/<uuid>.jsonl.gz`.
- RecordingRepository singleton (StateFlow state/recordings/uploads, ~4 Hz UI updates),
  flat `recordings.json` index (Room later), ActivityUploader via OkHttp
  (create → raw → finish; server id canonical for upload, local UUID stays file key).
- Record UI: permission flow, big Start, glanceable dark recording layout
  (displayLarge elapsed, km/h, accuracy, sample counters), recordings list with
  upload states. BuildConfig API_BASE_URL default http://10.0.2.2:8080.
- 6 unit tests pin exact JSONL of every line type to the spec. assembleDebug green.

**Backend**: the three ingest endpoints per proto/raw-recording-format.md
(create 201 / raw 204 with 400/404/413/415 guards, streamed to blob store / finish 204).
`internal/blob`: Store interface, S3(minio-go) impl + FS fallback (BLOB_DIR).
Migration 0002: user_id nullable, ended_at added. 23 unit tests + full e2e smoke
against dockerized PostGIS (arm64 note: postgis/postgis has no arm64 manifest —
use imresamu/postgis locally; noted in deploy compose). openapi.yaml updated.

**Open:**
- No retry queue for uploads (WorkManager later); no auth (v1.5).
- Not yet run on a real device/emulator — next session: install, record a walk,
  upload, eyeball the JSONL.

## 2026-07-11 — Phase 1.1: save flow, background upload, ARM images

Owner requirements: fully offline recording + save; upload in background when the
user saves; title/description/bike entered at save time. Also: the Coolify VPS is
ARM — deploy compose now uses multi-arch `imresamu/postgis` everywhere.

**Android:**
- Save sheet after Stop: title (prefilled by time of day), description, bike picker
  as horizontal selectable cards + inline "Add bike" dialog (Full-sus/Hardtail/
  E-bike/Other); bikes persist in `bikes.json`, last-used preselected. Discard with
  confirm deletes file + entry.
- Upload rewritten to WorkManager: unique work per recording (KEEP), NetworkType.
  CONNECTED, exponential backoff, 5 attempts then terminal `failed` with manual
  Retry. Server id persisted after create → retries skip create (idempotent).
  Repository re-enqueues `pending_upload` entries on init.
- Recording status lifecycle persisted in the index: recorded → pending_upload →
  uploaded / failed; unsaved recordings reopen the save sheet ("Finish saving"),
  surviving process death. 13 unit tests green, assembleDebug green.

**Backend:**
- Migration 0003: activities.title/description/bike/bike_type (nullable, CHECK on
  bike_type enum). finish accepts optional metadata (caps: 200/5000/100, Unicode
  rune counts); missing == empty == NULL. 33 tests + e2e smoke on imresamu/postgis
  (migrations up/down round-trip verified). openapi.yaml + raw-recording-format.md
  updated.

**Open:** same as above (device test pending) + WorkManager job not yet observed
end-to-end on device with real airplane-mode toggling.

## 2026-07-11 — First real device test + crash recovery (Phase 1.2)

**Field test** (OnePlus 9 Pro, Android 16): 4 short recordings saved fine. One
13-min ride was KILLED mid-recording by OxygenOS (ApplicationExitInfo reason=13
"o-kill", importance=125 — FGS alive when killed; OnePlus = aggressive OEM killer).
File survived as truncated gzip, but was invisible in-app (index entry was only
created at Stop) → user believed the ride lost.

**Data quality findings (great news):**
- IMU: 501 Hz, zero gaps >50 ms. GPS: 1.06 Hz, median accuracy 3.8 m (one 60 m
  outlier). No barometer on this device (sensor absent) — handled gracefully.
- Airtime concept validated on raw data: bunny hops visible as ~200 ms low-|a|
  windows; stair-drop landing peaked at 19.8 g. Simple thresholding already works.

**Fixes shipped:**
- Index entry now created at Start (status `recording`) — active-recording marker.
- Startup recovery: repairs truncated gzip (decompress until error, atomic rewrite),
  recovers orphan files and stuck `recording` entries → status `recorded` +
  `recovered: true`, "Recovered after crash" + Finish saving in UI. Never deletes
  unrecoverable files (raw-forever principle). 7 new unit tests.
- START_STICKY resume: null-intent restart repairs the file and CONTINUES recording,
  appending a new gzip member (RFC 1952 multi-member; readers handle it).
- Writer: GZIPOutputStream(syncFlush=true) — the ~2 s loss bound is now actually
  guaranteed (before, flush() didn't force the deflater).
- PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK during recording; battery-optimization exemption dialog on Start
  (ACTION_REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS), never blocks recording.

**Open:**
- Backend still not deployed to Coolify — uploads from the phone can't complete
  outside the dev Wi-Fi (APK bakes the Mac's LAN IP). Deploy = next step.
- Re-test on device: recovery of the real 12 MB orphan, kill-resilience on a long
  ride with exemption granted, airplane-mode upload queue.

## 2026-07-11 — Activity detail screen with map (:feature:activity)

New `:feature:activity` module: `ActivityDetailScreen(recordingId, onBack)` —
stats header (title/start time, bike, upload-status chip; tiles for duration,
distance, avg/max speed, `—` placeholders for Descent/Airtime pending
fusion-core) over an interactive MapLibre map (11.11.0, OpenFreeMap Liberty
style — free vector tiles, no API key) with the ride polyline in the theme
accent, camera fitted to track bounds. MapView hosted via AndroidView with a
lifecycle-forwarding bridge (`rememberMapViewWithLifecycle`).

- `GpsTrackReader` in :core:recording: one streaming pass over the raw
  `.jsonl.gz`, extracts only `gps` lines (cheap substring pre-filter before
  JSON decode — IMU is ~500 Hz), tolerates multi-member gzip and truncated
  tails. Loudly documented as DISPLAY-ONLY: all real stats stay in fusion-core
  (arch principle 2); distance/speed tiles are marked TODO(fusion-core).
- Repository: new `recording(id): Flow<LocalRecording?>` accessor.
- Nav: recordings list rows now clickable → `onOpenActivity(id)` callback
  (feature stays navigation-free); :app NavHost gained `activity/{id}`.
- Verified: `:app:assembleDebug` green, :core:recording tests green; emulator
  smoke test with a seeded synthetic ride — Liberty tiles + polyline render,
  camera fit and back-navigation teardown OK.

**Open:** map tile cache/offline behavior untested; stats tiles swap to
fusion-core values once the UniFFI wiring lands.

## 2026-07-11 — fusion-core on-device via UniFFI (device-first compute lands)

Architecture pivot recorded in DECISIONS: raw stays ON DEVICE, server will get
only processed artifacts (fused track, results+uncertainty, IMU evidence pack;
raw windows on request for KOM verification). Phone = primary computer.

- Toolchain: rustup installed user-level (~/.cargo, --no-modify-path; MacPorts
  rust untouched), Android targets + cargo-ndk 4.1.2, NDK 27.1.
- fusion-core: recording.rs parser (MultiGzDecoder — multi-member gzip from
  crash-resume; tolerates truncated tails, unknown line types), analysis.rs
  with UniFFI-exported `analyze_recording(path) -> RideAnalysis` + 
  `algorithm_version()` (ALGORITHM_VERSION = "gps-naive-0.1", documented as
  pre-Kalman). v0: accuracy gate >20 m, anchored haversine, moving time,
  median+hysteresis altitude, airtime via 150 ms trailing-mean |a| < 4 m/s²
  (window edges centered so landing_peak_g catches the spike). 12 tests incl.
  REAL fixture testdata/forest-30s.jsonl.gz — detects the actual bunny hop
  (t≈+23.4 s, 164 ms, 11.9 g landing).
- Bindings: crates/uniffi-bindgen shim, uniffi.toml pins Kotlin pkg
  com.dhava.fusion; fusion/scripts/build-android.sh (cargo-ndk arm64+x86_64 →
  jniLibs, bindgen → Kotlin). Generated Kotlin + .so COMMITTED for now (app
  builds without Rust toolchain; CI takes over later).
- android :core:fusion: thin FusionCore facade (analyze from Dispatchers.IO),
  jna dep. :feature:activity now uses it: Distance/Avg/Max/Descent/Airtime
  tiles show fusion-core values ("1.2 s × 3" airtime format); Kotlin TrackStats
  deleted — GPS parsing remains for the map polyline only.

**Open:** GPS-altitude descent is garbage on wooded trails (fixture showed
9.9 m ascent / 0 descent on an actual descent) — expected; Kalman + IMU next.
Ascent/descent tiles will look wrong until then. Track from RideAnalysis
(1 Hz decimated) could replace the Kotlin polyline pass later.
## 2026-07-12 — Rust live fusion + recording map

Finished the previously uncommitted fusion foundation (`linalg`, `orientation`,
`ekf`) and wired it into fusion-core. Added `LiveFusion`, a stateful UniFFI API
that consumes reduced-rate IMU plus GPS and emits display-rate fused snapshots:
Mahony attitude, 6-state ENU EKF, accuracy/Mahalanobis GPS gates and IMU
stationarity-driven ZUPT. Android-reported GPS speed is deliberately ignored
while stationary, fixing the observed ~10 km/h chair-speed. Two live-specific
tests plus the existing math tests pass (30 fusion-core tests total including
the forest fixture).

RecordingService now preserves raw ~500 Hz sensor capture but feeds live fusion
at 50 Hz to avoid JNI/battery waste. RecordingState exposes bounded fused track
points, fused speed and STILL/MOVING. RecordScreen now renders a MapLibre live
map with a growing fused polyline/current-position marker and follows the rider;
map rendering only exists while the recording UI is composed. Generated UniFFI
Kotlin and arm64/x86_64 native libraries were refreshed.

Verified: `cargo test -p fusion-core` and strict clippy green; recording unit
tests and `:app:assembleDebug` green. Installed on the x86_64 emulator and
started a recording: native LiveFusion loaded, recording service/UI ran without
crashes. Physical-device install subsequently completed on the OnePlus 9 Pro
(LE2123, arm64); app launch produced no native/MapLibre crashes. Manual
stationary-speed and outdoor-track validation remain the next field checks.

**OnePlus stationary calibration:** first field test still showed 0.8 km/h.
Pulled the live raw recording from the device: stationary accel error median
0.056 / p95 0.244 m/s², but gyro had isolated spikes up to 0.31 rad/s despite
median 0.028. The original all-samples-below-0.12 rule could therefore never
enter ZUPT. Stationarity now gates on 700 ms window means (accel <0.45 m/s²,
gyro <0.15 rad/s), with a regression test proving sustained 0.5 rad/s rotation
is still classified moving. Rust tests/clippy green; rebuilt and reinstalled on
the OnePlus for another stationary check.

Second field check converged only to 0.2 km/h. The new raw file confirmed IMU
was calm and GPS itself continuously reported 0.27–0.36 km/h drift. Added a
Rust low-speed rest guard: fused <0.35 m/s plus reported GPS <0.5 m/s collapses
velocity via ZUPT and emits `0.0 / STILL` (well below the existing canonical
0.7 m/s moving threshold). Regression test added; 31 unit tests + forest fixture
and strict clippy green; rebuilt and reinstalled on OnePlus.

Walking regression found immediately: low-speed guard could emit `MOVING` with
0.0 km/h indoors. Device trace proved strong motion (gyro 0.5–2.9 rad/s) and
GPS walking speed up to 2.9 km/h, so a speed-only floor is invalid. Removed the
guard entirely: only confirmed IMU stationarity may zero speed. Added assertion
that sustained rotation preserves nonzero speed; tests/clippy green and corrected
native build installed on OnePlus.

Third cycle exposed `MOVING` persisting after a stop. Full 80 s device trace
showed long calm periods punctuated by brief IMU bursts; a stateless window can
flip at an unlucky GPS snapshot. Replaced direct classification with hysteretic
state transitions: 500 ms sustained calm enters STILL, 250 ms sustained motion
exits. Added a stop→move→stop regression test proving speed returns to zero;
31 tests + fixture and strict clippy green, installed on OnePlus.

Runtime/offline mismatch root-caused: the short failing recording had no usable
GPS callback, and Android only copied Rust's `stationary` flag when a GPS
snapshot arrived. IMU correctly entered STILL offline but UI remained at its
initial MOVING state indefinitely. `push_imu` now returns the live stationarity
state on every 50 Hz update; service immediately publishes STILL/0 without GPS.
On transition to MOVING it clears stale zero speed until a fresh GPS snapshot
exists (`— km/h` is honest when indoor GPS cannot estimate speed). Tests/clippy
green; rebuilt and installed on OnePlus.

Final runtime root cause: live IMU downsampling initialized
`lastLiveImuMs = Long.MIN_VALUE`; Kotlin's first `timestamp - MIN_VALUE`
overflowed negative, so the first IMU sample was rejected and the sentinel was
never advanced — every IMU sample was rejected forever. Rust diagnostics showed
`accelMean/gyroMean = Infinity`, making the issue unambiguous. Sentinel is now
handled explicitly before subtraction. Automated physical-device UI test after
install: `STILL`, `0.0 km/h`; Rust log showed accel mean 0.009, gyro mean 0.0014,
calm for 5.4 s. Test recording stopped cleanly.
